# AHA Programming
- AHA stands for Avoid Hasty Abstractions
- Sendi Metz: "prefer duplication over the wrong abstraction"
- Related to to KISS: keep it simple stupid.

# Optimize for change
- Optimize for change first, only then optimize code for performance or absctraction.
- We can spend time optimizing code for performance or abstraction, only to find out the next day and the code is no longer needed. All we can really be sure of is that things will probably change.
