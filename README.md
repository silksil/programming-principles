# AHA Programming
- AHA stands for Avoid Hasty Abstraction
- Write the abstraction when it feels right and don't be afraid to duplicate code until you get there.
- Sendi Metz: "prefer duplication over the wrong abstraction".
- Pushes back against the **DRY** and **WET** principle. 

# Optimize for change
- Optimize for change first, only then optimize code for performance or absctraction.
- We can spend time optimizing code for performance or abstraction, only to find out the next day and the code is no longer needed. All we can really be sure of is that things will probably change.

# Execute then consider
- Execute something that is good, but not perfect. Evaluate how it works and then make changes.
